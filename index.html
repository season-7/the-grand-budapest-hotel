The Grand Budapest which is superbly located in the centre of Zanzibar , is a favourite choice of celebrities, world leaders, royalty and high society.</p>
            <p>Spacious, luxurious and elegant, each room features specially commissioned fabrics, antique furniture and exceedingly comfortable beds, while our white marble bathrooms are said to feature the deepest baths in East Africa.
