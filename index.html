            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>As one of the world&#39;s most iconic luxury hotels, The Grand Budapest is quite simply the place to be in East Africa. Whether you are staying in one of the exquisite rooms and suites, unwinding in the spa, enjoying Michelin-starred cuisine or indulging in an award-winning afternoon tea, you will experience the epitome of timeless glamour. The Grand Budapest which is superbly located in the centre of Zanzibar , is a favourite choice of celebrities, world leaders, royalty and high society.</p>

            <p>Spacious, luxurious and elegant, each room features specially commissioned fabrics, antique furniture and exceedingly comfortable beds, while our white marble bathrooms are said to feature the deepest baths in East Africa. The Grand Budapest is the only hotel restaurant in East Africa with three Michelin-stars, putting its creative French cuisine firmly in East Africa's culinary spotlight. Enjoy the finest pastries with your afternoon tea at The Promenade, visit the hotspot that is China Tang or The Grill. At The Budapest Spa, a beautifully designed oasis, indulge in signature spa treatments such as the Aromatherapy Associates massage, then unwind in the glamorous Art Deco relaxation room before heading to The Spatisserie for a glass of champagne.</p>
